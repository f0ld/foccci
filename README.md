# foccci - The Fully Open CCS Charge Controller Interface

Charge Controller that enables CCS charging of homebrew electric vehicles.
Driven by the OpenInverter forum community, https://openinverter.org/forum/
Based on the QCA7005 PLC modem and an STM32 microcontroller.

# News

## 2023-10-25 First Order of Populated Boards

Received four reservations on openinverter forum, and this was the trigger to create version v4.1 with minor layout
improvements, and to order a batch of five
at JLCPCB. Total cost for five: $127.32 including shipping, taxes and duties. The NCV8402 was out of stock,
and the QCA7005 is anyway not in their stock. So the material price is

- 25€ JLCPCB populated PCB
- 12€ QCA7005
- 4€ 2 x NCV8402
- 1€ RF transformator
- <1€ connectors for programming and serial line

## 2023-10-08 Light-Bulb-Demo-Charging on Alpitronic and ABB works

Using the foccci V3 board together with ccs32clara software, the muehlpower voltage sense board, a cheap chinese relay, the light-bulb-demo
worked on the first attempt on alpitronics hypercharger and on an ABB triple charger.

## 2023-07-28 Charging Loop Reached

The foccci board version 2023-07-12 runs the STM32F103 and the QCA7005, and successfully enters
the charging loop, with simulated evse by pyPLC. It provides the checkpoint number and some other
informations via CAN with 500kBaud. On the other side of the CAN sits an ESP32 Wifi-Kit-32, with
a CAN transceiver added. It shows the data of the CAN on its OLED display.

## 2023-07-09 The board starts talking

After the PCBs and QCAs arrived, the soldering was the next challenge. It went well, and the board started talking to
the ESP32 running ccs32berta https://github.com/uhi22/ccs32berta

https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=58627#p58627

## 2023-06-21 First PCB with the QCA7005

...is ready in KiCad and is sent to JLCPCB. It is a two-layer, and has so many capacitors, that they do not really fit
to the place where they would make sense. Caused by taking the schematic from the Millisman design, but changing
the size to 1206 for easy hand soldering. Btw: Below five dollars for five PCBs, including shipping, duties and taxes.

## 2023-06-14 The Idea Is Born

...and the discussion is starting on the OpenInverter forum
https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=57643#p57643

# Board versions

- Issues:
    - Diode to 3V3 is missing in the CP sense path (R58). Need to be patched.
    - There is a via near the pin1-corner of the QCA, which is very near to the metal frame at the corner, and may cause shortcut between 1V2 and ground.

## V4 2023-09-10

![image](doc/foccci_v4_2023-09-10_3DView.jpg)
- Prepared for assembling by JLCPCB
- No 1206 size components anymore. Means: 0805 is the new default size now.
- Test result summary: PCBs ordered on 25/10/23. No testing done yet.

## V4.1 2023-10-25

- functionally identical to V4
- moved via away from QCA corner to avoid solder bridge
- silk screen improvements: more component names and better readability

## V5 work in progress

- main goal: sleep-wakeup-logic

# Background

The QCA7005 schematic and board was originally designed by Millisman https://github.com/Millisman/QCA7000, then forked to https://github.com/uhi22/QCA7000board and then renamed to https://github.com/uhi22/foccci

# Changes to the original Millisman design

## Schematic
- removed JTAG completely
- removed connector for SPI flash, added testpoints instead

- ATP_P and ATP_N are reserved analog test points. Leave unconnected without testpoints.
- ZC_IN connected to ground. Not used.
- PLL_BYPASS has an internal pulldown. Removed the external pulldown.
- Removed the LEDs on the GPIO.
- RSVD06 and 07 are "do not connect". Removed the test points.
- Bugfix: The ground was missing between C13 and C14.

## symbol QCA7000:
 - RSVD01 changed to power_in, because connected to 3.3V
 - RSVD04 changed to power_in, because connected to 1.2V
 - TCK changed from output to input, because this is the test clock driven by debugger. Even if the data sheet says "output".

## Footprints in Schematic

- changed the 100nF to 1206 for easy handsoldering (and back to 0805 for some, to safe space)
- changed the 10µF to 1210
- changed other 0603 Cs to 0805
- changed L and Rs to 1206 (and the beads back to 0805)



## Todos for now

- [ ] TVS at the 12V. SMAJ18A ?
- [ ] TVS at the CP
- [ ] Docu: add details of step-by-step bring-up, incl current consumption


## Todos for Later

- [ ] Add additional mounting holes and and optional "Molex Mini-Fit Jr. Header, Dual Row" for the case, that the Deutsch is not needed in certain use cases.
- [ ] The use of the LEDs on GPIO0 to 3 is not clear. Are they used in the automotive firmware at all? GPIO3: on the CCM, this is connected to µC.43 via R8 (0 ohms). Measure the pin.
- [ ] Regarding AMS1117-3.3 for the 3v3 regulators. These are tried and tested, but you may wish to avoid the polarized capacitor by using a more modern regulator. Consider TLV75733PDBV "Stable With a 1-μF Ceramic Output Capacitor"
- [ ] The STM32F103 seems to meet the requirements and it's popular but be aware that it has a basic ARM core with no FPU. And: Do we need a low-power variant (stm32L4 series)?
- [ ] Low-power concept is missing. Is the unit permanently powered? Do we need sleep/wakeup via inputs and/or CAN?
- [ ] What's the plan for the PLC coupling circuit between J7 and J1, have you found a suitable transformer? The Pulse BMU6201NL transformer might do (it's qualified for the qca700x, see https://www.pulseelectronics.com/wideband-power-line-communication-plc-transformers/) and is available from Mouser
- [ ] The QCA7005 is labelled QCA7000.
- [ ] missing the JTAG port pull down resistors on the QCA
- [ ] Could do with one more processor decoupler so that a cap can be dropped right against every package power pin.
- [ ] Would be worth adding lines to the QCA7005 Reset (so that is can be reset without a power cycle) and the Int pins (just in case it's needed in the future).
- [ ] Might put a Schottky protection diode on the temperate sense inputs.
- [ ] Clarify interface (electrically and mechanically)
    - [ ] Electrically: Interface ideas here: https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=58697#p58697
- [ ] supply voltage measurement (to be able to adjust the PWM for contactors according to the supply voltage, and just for info)

# Requirements for the low-power-mode

- The foccci shall fall in low-power-mode, if not needed. The consumption shall be less than 5mA during this mode.
- The foccci shall use the enable pin of the step down converter TPS54302 to shut down the power supply.
- The following ways shall be used to activate the high-power-mode:
    - CP line: A significant voltage (above 4V) for a significant time (at least some milliseconds).
    - Button: A button to ground, internally pulled-up to 12V, if pressed long enough (at least some milliseconds).
    - microcontroller: The STM32 shall be able to keep itself powered by using a toggle pin. In case of stuck to high or low, the foccci shall power-down.
    - Not planned at the moment: Wakeup via CAN communication. This would be a helpful use case, if the user wakes the car via remote key (unlock), and the connector is unlocked by this activity.

# First run of the June 2023 version

- Starting with power suppy connected to the 3V3, but set to 0V. Slowly increase the voltage to 0.5V. Observe the current. No current is good.
- Measure, whether the DVDD pins of the QCA and 3 pins of the Flash have 0.5V.
- Connect multimeter to 1V2, and turn the power supply slowly up.
- With 2V, the board draws 4.5mA.
- At 2.7V, the current jumps from 6mA to 13mA. This is when the 1.2V regulator starts delivering its intended output voltage.
- At 3.3V, the current is 20mA. This does not look like normal operating current.
- On the L10 input, there is a 0V/3.3V quare wave with 600ns cycle time. This looks normal for the step-down-converter.
- On the R6 (both sides), there is the 25MHz clock, with ~1V amplitude.
- The Reset line is 3.3V (no reset). When pulling it to ground, the current consumption increases from 20.8mA to 23mA.
- The CS of the Flash is permanent high. This means, the QCA does not want to load its programm code from the Flash. Something is wrong.
- The RBIAS and R_BIASREF were not populated. Added them.
- Looks better: At 3V3, the current is 80mA. At the CS of the Flash there is activity for one second after power-on. Seems the QCA is fetching its program code.
- Connect the ESP32 with the ccs32berta via SPI, using 220 ohm protection resistors in all four SPI lines. ESP powered via USB, QCA powered from 3.3V bench power supply. Result: The Berta finds the modem and starts the SLAC.


# Programming the SPI Flash

An introduction how to use a Raspberry to program the SPI flash is here:
https://www.rototron.info/recover-bricked-bios-using-flashrom-on-a-raspberry-pi/
The connection is quite simple: SPI_FLASH_programming_with_Raspberry.jpg

Make sure that SPI is enabled in the settings of the Raspberry.
Install the flashrom tool: `sudo apt-get install flashrom`
The docu of flashrom is here: https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom

Check whether the device is detected: `flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=2000 -V`

Binary is available here: https://github.com/uhi22/Ioniq28Investigations/blob/main/CCM_ChargeControlModule_PLC_CCS/CCM_FlashDump_SpiFlash_2MB_Ioniq_00_33_79.bin

For viewing the binary, a hex editor can be used, e.g. http://www.funduc.com/fshexedit.htm

To flash the binary file to the SPI flash: `flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=2000 -w myfile.bin` In the case that to tool complains that multiple flash chip definitions match the detected chip, choose the correct one with the option `-c "MX25L...something...`

# Create Fabrication Output for JLCPCB

Starting with KiCad7, the The xsltproc appears to have been removed. So the procedure to create the BOM needs to be adjusted.
In https://gist.github.com/arturo182/a8c4a4b96907cfccf616a1edb59d0389 we find, that there is a plugin now: "Fabrication Toolkit".
This can be installed with the "Plugin and Content Manager" in the KiCad main window.
Then, in the PCB editor, use the FabricationToolkit from the toolbar. This creates a new folder in <project>/production/, which
contains a zip with Gerber and drill files, and also the BOM, positions and designator files.

The docu of the Fabrication Toolkit is here: https://github.com/bennymeg/JLC-Plugin-for-KiCad

Some of the IC footprints have the wrong orientation in the JLCPCB viewer. The Fabrication toolkit offers the possibility to
rotate (and shift, if necessary) the footprints, by adding in the schematic an attribute 'JLCPCB Rotation Offset'.
Thanks to jrbe for the hint in https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=61049#p61049
